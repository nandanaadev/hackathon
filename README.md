The problem we're addressing is the traffic that ambulances have to deal with when going to or getting a patient from a location.
Our solution to the said problem is to implement a website where every citizen with a vehicle registers, thereby creating their own password.
the website on opening asks the user for their location which they are expected to provide.
Using this location, we can alert the vehicles that fall within a 1 kilometer vicinity of the ambulance to clear the way.
To implement the alert, (using government sanction) we'd make it so that a small device is installed in every vehicle with the aforementioned site including but not limited to cars, bikes, trucks, buses, etc and also ambulances.
