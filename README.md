The problem we're addressing is the traffic that ambulances have to deal with when going to or getting a patient from a location.
Our solution to the said problem is to implement a website where every citizen with a vehicle registers, thereby creating their own password.
the website on opening asks the user for their location which they are expected to provide.
Using this location, we can alert the vehicles that fall within a 1 kilometer vicinity of the ambulance to clear the way.
To implement the alert, (using government sanction) we'd make it so that a small device is installed in every vehicle with the aforementioned site including but not limited to cars, bikes, trucks, buses, etc and also ambulances.
This system is installed solely for the emergency alerts and cannot be used for other purposes.
The alert would be oral/vocal so the drivers don't have to look away from the road when driving.
The device is activated only when the automobile engine is on.
To distinguish between 'parked but turned on cars' and 'cars in a road block'(the former shouldn't receive the alert while the latter should), we use motion sensors and traffic analysis. All vehicles that are currently moving would receive an alert along with vehicles that are stationary but on a main road.
All ambulance drivers must register once to the site with their personal details, hospital name and hospital id for the purpose of verifying their credentials.
Every subsequent login would use his/her email id and password or if the user prefers it, to stay logged in.
Once an ambulance driver logs in before a ride, they hit the "MAKE WAY" button which sends out the required signal.

To implement this idea, we use html, css and javascript to design the website interface and sql for the database.
We'd also need government permissions, sanctions and funding to go ahead with this project.
We'd also need the citizens to cooperate and allow us access to their location (only) when an ambulance is nearby.

We hope that this project, if implemented successfully provides the few seconds required to save a person's life.
